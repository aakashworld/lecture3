<h1>  Hippo Poem   </h1>

<p> My favorite <a href="http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/ogden_nash/poems/19638">poem</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus">Hippos</a>.
    Here is how it goes</p>

<pre>Behold the hippopotamus!
We laugh at how he looks to us,
And yet in moments dank and grim,
    I wonder how we look to him. </pre>

<pre>Peace, peace, thou hippopotamus!
We really look all right to us,
As you no doubt delight the eye,
    Of other hippopotami. </pre>
